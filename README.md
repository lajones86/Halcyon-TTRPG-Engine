# Halcyon TTRPG Engine

A Javascript project leveraging standards-compliant HTML5 and CSS to strive toward simple JSON modularity.

The goal is to provide a general-purpose FOSS tool that allows for quickly scaling TTRPG Concepts in a wide range of situations.

Guiding principles are stability and portability, with an emphasis on FOSS.

My primary dev browser is Firefox on Android and Windows. I play a wide variety of well-known and lesser-known TTRPGs.
